            In order to execute more specific database operations custom queries must be used. These can be run through the <b>runQuery(String query)</b>
            method of the SQLConnection object.
        </p>
        <h5 class="header">The runQuery method</h5>
        <p>
            The runQuery method is the core and most versatile method of the SQLConnection class, and your best friend when accessing operating
            on a database.
            Its operation is very simple, but requires knowledge of the SQL language. If you are new to SQL or need to brush-up on the syntax,
            we personally reccommend you visit w3schools.com's <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/">SQL tutorial</a>. It is extremely concise and
            to the point.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to run a query through the runQuery method, just specify the SQL query in a string and give it as a parameter to the function.
            Any result from the query will be returned as a table after the command runs successfully. If there is any error, an error message will be
            displayed in the console.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through this command, the possibilities are endless, but be careful that the syntax is all correct or the commands won't work!
